* 96% of internet applications use open source
* 11% - 57% of codebases are open source
* $387 billion market cap (10x of ETH at the time)
* not high-enough pay to do OSS fulltime
* donation buttons on repos to get some support, github funding (centralized)
* Gitcoin experiments:
  * Gitcoin Grants - allocating 1.2m to projects per year (for 2020), eventually called Quadratic Funding
  * DAOs - MolochDAO was the Minimum Viable DAO:
    * forked by many (MetaCartel, MetaVentures, etc)
    * DAO can work like a focussed Gitcoin Grant by raising funds for types of issues
  * Block Rewards Funding - EIP-1789 suggest 10% increase in block rewards which goes to funding developers (at $100m a year)
  * OSCoin, SourceCred - reward contributions to a repository
