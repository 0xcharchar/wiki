* Housing DAO - investment DAO that supports rent to own with the goal of simplifying home ownership and sustainable housing
* Soft consensus - improving the soft consensus mechanism in DAOs so that the history can be attached to a final decision vote
* Decentralized website creator - create website from your phone and have it automatically hosted on ipfs, work as a node in the ipfs network
* [[Timelocked lottery contract]] - contract that releases the bounty after a certain block time. Withdrawl would be a race to be the first person to run the withdrawl request. To withdraw the money, you have to pay a small fee (besides the gas fee) to build up the next pot.
* POAPs for visiting the site - they should be drawn terribly. https://app.poap.xyz/admin/events
* [[Pet Insurance as a community fund]] - run by a DAO, claims vetted by professional Vets (pitch as side-hustle income??), scale monthly payments based on available funds distributed across number of people, everyone pays the same amount
