= Vimwiki Github Action =

So I've got a vimwiki. Now I want to make it a website. I have no interest in doing this manually.

== Vim setup ==

There is a `:VimwikiAll2HTML` vim command. This requires:

* a template (done, added to [[/templates/default.html]]
* changes to *.vimrc*:
  {{{vim
		let g:vimwiki_list = [{
			\ 'path': '/path/to/wiki',
			\ 'template_path': '/path/to/wiki/templates',
			\ 'template_default': 'default',
			\ 'template_ext': '.html'}]
	}}}
* it is possible to run the html command from the shell:
  {{{sh
  vim +VimwikiAll2HTML +quit index.wiki
  }}}
* When the HTML is generated, it defaults to *vimwiki_html/*. I assume this is because the default installation uses *vimwiki/* as the wiki location. 

== Problems to solve ==

* The CSS is not grabbed from the templates directory, afaik. It is possible to pre-create the vimwiki_html folder and drop a CSS file in.
* How the fuck to create a Github action:
  * https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-docker-container-action

== Log ==

* have a simple image based on alpine that:
  * installs git and vim
  * creates a new user/group
  * switches to new user
* trying to clone vimwiki plugin is not working, getting: "could not create work tree dir"
