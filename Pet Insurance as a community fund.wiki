CALL IT PETS.INSURANCE FOR THE MEMES

== Goals ==

* visible pool of funds for transparency
* clear claim rulings
* community governance with vote delegation:
  * probably a governance token like Gitcoin
* transparent raising/lowering of monthly fees:
  * fees are based on size of fund with the goal of lowering fees over time
  * use DeFi to increase fund (with goal of lowering fees)
* pay professionals to review claims
* equal payments for all participants

== "Business Case" ==

This isn't a business, its a community fund, but we should know how much insurance companies make to understand if we can do better.
