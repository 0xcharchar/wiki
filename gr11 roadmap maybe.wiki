* start building eth2/swarm/matrix combo sffpc/all-in-ones

== Web2 service provider ==

Servers to run odd jobs or APIs are still useful but paying for them requires a trusted person with a credit card. Why not build, on top of cloud infra, a PaaS that accepts crypto payments? Get the scaling power of AWS/GCP/Azure with less permission concerns. Make ownership available to DAO members, or select DAO members. Build integrations with Gnosis safe or Moloch treasuries
