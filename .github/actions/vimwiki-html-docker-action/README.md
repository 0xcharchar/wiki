# Vimwiki-Pandoc Github Action

Turn a vimwiki set of files into a static website using pandoc.

## Journey

1. Started with the built-in `:Vimwiki2HTML`, had problems with link generation and didn't want to edit vimscript for changes
2. Looked at markdown options (as that was easier to customize) but switching all the files to markdown was uninteresting
3. Found the PR to add vimwiki support to pandoc, started testing with that
