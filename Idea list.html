      <ul>
      <li>Housing DAO - investment DAO that supports rent to own with the goal of simplifying home ownership and sustainable housing</li>
      <li>Soft consensus - improving the soft consensus mechanism in DAOs so that the history can be attached to a final decision vote</li>
      <li>Decentralized website creator - create website from your phone and have it automatically hosted on ipfs, work as a node in the ipfs network</li>
      <li><a href="Timelocked lottery contract.html" title="wikilink">Timelocked lottery contract</a> - contract that releases the bounty after a certain block time. Withdrawl would be a race to be the first person to run the withdrawl request. To withdraw the money, you have to pay a small fee (besides the gas fee) to build up the next pot.</li>
      <li>POAPs for visiting the site - they should be drawn terribly. <a href="https://app.poap.xyz/admin/events">https://app.poap.xyz/admin/events</a></li>
      <li><a href="Pet Insurance as a community fund.html" title="wikilink">Pet Insurance as a community fund</a> - run by a DAO, claims vetted by professional Vets (pitch as side-hustle income??), scale monthly payments based on available funds distributed across number of people, everyone pays the same amount</li>
      <li>Tip jar - accept ether, erc20, and erc721. Assets should go immediately to some sort of staking or LP. Fractionalize the ERC721s to support investments? Would be cool if withdrawl function cut 10% off the total and that was distributed to tippers based on their contribution percent to the jar</li>
      <li><a href="Swear jar contract.html" title="wikilink">Swear jar contract</a> - ERC1155 or ERC721 token with built-in minting using a whitelist. The token details do not exist until an oracle adds them</li>
      </ul>
