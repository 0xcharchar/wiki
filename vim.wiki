Various snippets and things I frequently forget

== JSON ==

=== JS to JSON ===

Copying a Javascript object out of code and into its own JSON file involves a
painful process of quoting things. This snippet will wrap quotes around each
key:

{{{regex
:%s/\zs[a-z]\+\ze:/"\0"/g
}}}

* `\zs` and `\ze` mark the start/end of the pattern
* `[a-z]\+` gets any number of lowercase alpha characters, should be updated
  for more complex keys
* `:` to make sure the key is grabbed and not random words
* `"\0"` is the entire match, inside quotes

=== Format JSON ===

{{{vim
:%!python -m json.tool
}}}
