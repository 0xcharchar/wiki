    this is a governance minimization pilot i was talking about. work in progress
    with RaidGuild, but totally functions on Gnosis Chain (although there may be a
    few UI/UX 'bugs'). every dao proposal is actually a purpose driven dao/subdao
    itself.
    
    like 2 pizza teams executing, through crowdfunding for dao initiatives. Dao from
    day 1 with ragequit built in from day 1.
