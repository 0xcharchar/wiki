= WTF is a DAO =

*D* ecentralized
*A* utonomous
*O* rganization

That still doesn't mean a thing, does it? The original intent, as far as I know, was an organization centralized around a piece of code. The code controlled finalized decision making, usually from a vote.

This is no longer the case.

Plenty of groups are spinning up a token and calling themselves a DAO by having a Discord channel. Not a bad thing but it really muddys the water around terminology.

So.

== What can a DAO be? ==

Maybe we break down each word, out of order.

=== Organization ===

This is easy. Any collection of people that are organized around one thing. This could be a football club, a FinTech startup, or prisoners picking up trash in the park.

=== Decentralized ===

A slightly trickier word that is often confused with _Distributed_. Decentralized means there is no central 'thing'. No office or multiple offices. No vault or multiple vaults. No central piece of code or multiple bits of code forming a thing.

Something decentralized has no center. You could take part away and it would still function. It doesn't have to function well but must continue.
