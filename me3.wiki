== Tasks ==

=== UI ===

* [o] redesign:
  * [o] pages:
    * [X] select subdomain
    * [X] social profiles form
    * [X] confirmation
    * [ ] user profile preview
    * [ ] marketing/landing page
  * [.] sections:
    * [X] header
    * [ ] publishing state
    * [ ] validations
    * [ ] social icon set
    * [ ] functional icon set
* [O] mobile style:
  * [X] basic menu
  * [X] header spacing
  * [X] body spacing
  * [ ] form spacing
  * [X] card spacing
* [ ] dark mode

=== Features ===

* [.] form validations:
  * [X] select subdomain
  * [ ] CID fields
  * [ ] URL fields
* [o] use IPNS for contenthash:
  * [X] ipns-update function
  * [ ] can we programatically determine the CID, on new sites, before the 2min process finishes?

=== Admin ===

* [ ] move email hosting somewhere else (current host only allows one user):
  * Inb0x from Parallel
  * Ethmail.cc
* [ ] deploy latest SiteManager contract:
  * [ ] determine gas cost difference between SiteManagerLite and minimal SiteManager request
* [ ] figure out IPFS node hosting
* [ ] figure out Netlify costs vs running an API vs finding another serverless provider

== Bugs ==

* [ ] if the domain search triggers while backspacing and the user completely empties the input box, validation status of the intermediate search still exists
* [X] if selecting a wallet and metamask is not connected, the profile icon still shows but is empty, button never returns
* [ ] validation icon does not always match the provided value, can happen when typing too slow
* [ ] on confirmation screen, the avatar has a higher index then the connect wallet modal
* [ ] final button should just say publish but trigger connect wallet if not connected
* [ ] avatar does not seem to be saved, a recent example:
  * https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x42D63ae25990889E35F215bC95884039Ba354115#readContract
    * call `text` with `0x594aa35033eb33efbdf97912b440c4dac7e476b596a4fe03564dd55ccd76cc8c` and `avatar`
  * Transaction: https://ropsten.etherscan.io/tx/0x4886559fce4053c79a974dae0925379d1ea6ba27c02ec5db5750889dae1c68a8
  * I think its being missed in the publish routine based on the input data
