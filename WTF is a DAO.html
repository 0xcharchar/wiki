<span id="WTF is a DAO-D"></span><strong id="D">D</strong> ecentralized
<span id="WTF is a DAO-A"></span><strong id="A">A</strong> utonomous
<span id="WTF is a DAO-O"></span><strong id="O">O</strong> rganization
</p>

<p>
That still doesn't mean a thing, does it? The original intent, as far as I know, was an organization centralized around a piece of code. The code controlled finalized decision making, usually from a vote.
</p>

<p>
This is no longer the case.
</p>

<p>
Plenty of groups are spinning up a token and calling themselves a DAO by having a Discord channel. Not a bad thing but it really muddys the water around terminology.
</p>

<p>
So.
</p>

<div id="WTF is a DAO-What can a DAO be?"><h2 id="What can a DAO be?" class="header"><a href="#WTF is a DAO-What can a DAO be?">What can a DAO be?</a></h2></div>

<p>
Maybe we break down each word, out of order.
</p>

<div id="WTF is a DAO-What can a DAO be?-Organization"><h3 id="Organization" class="header"><a href="#WTF is a DAO-What can a DAO be?-Organization">Organization</a></h3></div>

<p>
This is easy. Any collection of people that are organized around one thing. This could be a football club, a FinTech startup, or prisoners picking up trash in the park.
</p>

<div id="WTF is a DAO-What can a DAO be?-Decentralized"><h3 id="Decentralized" class="header"><a href="#WTF is a DAO-What can a DAO be?-Decentralized">Decentralized</a></h3></div>

<p>
A slightly trickier word that is often confused with <em>Distributed</em>. Decentralized means there is no central 'thing'. No office or multiple offices. No vault or multiple vaults. No central piece of code or multiple bits of code forming a thing.
</p>

<p>
Something decentralized has no center. You could take part away and it would still function. It doesn't have to function well but must continue.
