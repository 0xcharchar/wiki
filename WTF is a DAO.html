      <p><span id="D"></span><strong>D</strong> ecentralized <span id="A"></span><strong>A</strong> utonomous <span id="O"></span><strong>O</strong> rganization</p>
      <p>That still doesn't mean a thing, does it? The original intent, as far as I know, was an organization centralized around a piece of code. The code controlled finalized decision making, usually from a vote.</p>
      <p>This is no longer the case.</p>
      <p>Plenty of groups are spinning up a token and calling themselves a DAO by having a Discord channel. Not a bad thing but it really muddys the water around terminology.</p>
      <p>So.</p>
      <h2 id="What can a DAO be?">What can a DAO be?</h2>
      <p>Maybe we break down each word, out of order.</p>
      <h3 id="Organization">Organization</h3>
      <p>This is easy. Any collection of people that are organized around one thing. This could be a football club, a FinTech startup, or prisoners picking up trash in the park.</p>
      <h3 id="Decentralized">Decentralized</h3>
      <p>A slightly trickier word that is often confused with <em>Distributed</em>. Decentralized means there is no central 'thing'. No office or multiple offices. No vault or multiple vaults. No central piece of code or multiple bits of code forming a thing.</p>
      <p>Something decentralized has no center. You could take part away and it would still function. It doesn't have to function well but must continue.</p>
