== How did we get here ==

Or the closely related question from my therapist: "Why are you doing this?"

A few months ago, a bunch of things came to head at the same time:

* I got in trouble at work for committing to an open-source project in the middle of the day (code was done but I had forgotten to commit, did it on my lunch break, sigh)
* working on open-source and crypto in my off-hours was getting too draining
* my day job is high paying but very easy, lots of downtime
* I have problems with authority

With all this, I figure that an anonymous account gives me the ability to work when I want. This gives me the freedom I am looking for to keep my family together, keep busy, and keep up with work obligations.

== Am I different ==

* the difficulties
* honesty
* crossing boundaries



== Building trust ==
