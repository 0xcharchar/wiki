<ul>
<li>
climate data helps businesses run and decentralizing it makes it more open

<li>
70% of global GDP is affected by weather

<li>
many people in the world are one catastrophe away from irreversible loss

<li>
historical data can be used for modelling and predicting

<li>
building:

<ul>
<li>
API for pulling climate data

<li>
"Construction App" -&gt; "Worksite weather risk calculator"

<li>
actionable data and insights

</ul>
<li>
Chainlink used for data validation (data validation is a specialized skillset)

<li>
Chainlink also used for governance

<li>
how smart contracts/blockchain help fight climate change:

<ul>
<li>
developing nations get access to immutable data and insurance products (open data)

<li>
many businesses can't handle one natural catastrophe

<li>
parametric insurance powered by oracles/immutable data/blockchain helps insurance company and businesses:

<ul>
<li>
reduces need for disaster aid

<li>
insurance can pay out much quicker and more accurate

<li>
businesses up and running sooner

</ul>
<li>
oracles essential to getting immutable/standardized data

</ul>
