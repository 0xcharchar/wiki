== Don't read storage variables too often ==

* better to create a `memory` variable and set its value to the storage variable
* update the storage variable at the end, if needed

== Pack your structs ==

* 32 is the magic number
* storage slots are 32 bytes each (`SSTORE`/`SLOAD`)
* order of a struct matters:
  {{{class="solidity"
    // inefficient storage, uses 3 slots
    `address wallet   // SLOT 1 20/32`
    `address backup   // SLOT 2 20/32`
    `uint96 first     // SLOT 2 32/32`
    `uint96 sec       // SLOT 3 12/32`
    
    // efficient storage, uses 2 slots
    `address wallet   // SLOT 1 20/32`
    `uint96 first     // SLOT 1 32/32`
    `address backup   // SLOT 2 20/32`
    `uint96 sec       // SLOT 2 32/32`
  }}}
  
== Use `constant` or `immutable` ==

* this has huge gas savings benefits
* making `constructor` initialized variables immutable when there are no plans to update

== Don't store unneccesary data ==

* try to use events instead

== Make variables obvious ==

* an example: Chainlink uses `s_` for storage variables
