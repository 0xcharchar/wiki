About building/deploying on Optimism L2

By Justin Moses

== Contract Management Gotchas ==

* block size is 24kb
* no selfDestruct
* uses wETHA

== Deployment ==

* no gas price or limit because the L1 is unknown

== Testing ==

* unit testing doesn't change (can still use hardhat for example)
* integration:
  * L1 tests using geth
  * L2 using geth OVM
  * combined uses both nodes

== Ownership ==

* multisig can live on L1
* messages relayed into L2
* avoids multisig on L2 (helps move across L2 without moving the wallet around)
