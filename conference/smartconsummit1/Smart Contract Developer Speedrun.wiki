= Smart Contract Developer Speedrun =

Players:
* austintgriffith -> scaffold-eth/keeper
* Zer0dot

== Any ERC20 ==

Goal: Ship an ERC20 coin called SmartCoin with 1000? and 18 decimals

Both used OpenZepplin ERC20 contracts.

The winner used Remix which allowed them to deploy way quicker (code writing was a bit slow from what I could see)

== 100% reactive NFT ==

Implement ERC721 that copies a value from another into your storage. The other contract updates a counter

* scaffold-eth gives you a web UI for testing and it shows all of the contrct data in a browser (mind-fucking-blowing for me)
* remix is still the fastest way to build a contract but you miss out on all the other tools
