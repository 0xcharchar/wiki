== Progress ==

* cloned repo
* started work on the {{Networth}} component
* joined the discord, trying to figure out where to ask questions
* created card views for the top of the page (Boost, networth, claims)

== Questions ==

* want this localized? is there a localization library already in use?
* ROI is value / value earned? Is that all the number needed? What is the graph representing?
